            Ohio is having a moment. If you haven’t been paying attention, there’s a hardcore renaissance happening in the Buckeye State. Over the course of the last two years, it’s become a hotbed for no-bullshit hardcore and power violence, led by bands like
            <a href="https://enlovehc.bandcamp.com/">En Love</a>,
            <a href="https://slugclevo.bandcamp.com/">SLUG</a>,
            <a href="https://primordialharvest.bandcamp.com/releases">Primordial Harvest</a>,
            and <a href="https://foryourhealth.bandcamp.com/">For Your Health</a>.
            All these groups swing the Ohio hardcore flag with honor, and in the manner of traditional hardcore, they’re bringing their friends, too.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2018, before many of these bands were formed, Ohio’s hardcore scene was in a drought. The number of venues and acts had dropped drastically compared to previous years. Touring acts and festivals weren&apos;t picking locals to open shows. And so, taking a page from the earliest hardcore tomes, some Columbus punks decided to speed up the cycle themselves. They looked at thriving scenes in Philadelphia and Denver and started taking notes.
        </p>

        <p>
            “We looked at how Ohio was languishing, and how much better we thought it could be, and wanted it to be,” says Nate Snitchler, a member of En Love,
            <a href="https://rejoiceohio.bandcamp.com/">Rejoice</a>,
            <a href="https://delayedgratificationrecords.bandcamp.com/album/in-my-restless-dreams">Snitch Bastard Judas</a>,
            and <a href="https://holykiss.bandcamp.com/">Holy Kiss</a>,
            “and we were like, ‘What if we just started every band?’”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Gradually, the number of bands started multiplying. Members from one band would team up with members of another to form something new. Members of En Love formed or joined the bands
            <a href="https://circuspunk.bandcamp.com/">Circus</a>,
            Rejoice, Snitch Bastard Judas, and Holy Kiss—all of which are made up of members from other local bands.
        </p>    

        <p>
            “It just kind of kept expanding like that from there, where every time we have an idea, we can just text someone else who was in this core group,” he says. “And then we ended up being like, ‘Oh, that’s a hundred bands now.’”

                Columbus wasn’t alone, though. Around the same time, hardcore bands began popping up across the state. In Northern Ohio,
                <a href="https://lastgaspoh.bandcamp.com/">Last Gasp</a>
                shares members with SLUG, who shares members with
                <a href="https://smile330.bandcamp.com/album/just-s-m-i-l-e">S.M.I.L.E.</a>
                Within a year or two, the foundations were strong, hardcore shows were happening, and fans got involved.
            </p>

            <p>
                It takes more than people to make a hardcore community, though. It’s also about uplifting each other, a credo Ohio bands and fans take to heart. En Love’s vocalist Joey Mendicino kicked off a recent set at
                <a href="https://hate5six.com/">Hate5Six</a>
                with a chest-thumping roll call: “This set goes out to Rejoice, to
                <a href="https://sothisisprogress.bandcamp.com/album/body-farm-debut-7">Body Farm</a>,
                to <a href="https://lastgaspoh.bandcamp.com/music">Last Gasp</a>,
                to SLUG, to
                <a href="https://thewayohio.bandcamp.com/releases">The Way</a>,
                to Circus.” It’s something which has become a ritual before each performance.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Every time, we will shout up the same bands,” explains Snitchler. “Every time, because it’s the team. Everybody eats. Our successes are everybody else’s successes. It’s not a competition at all for Ohio. It is all about everybody being more successful together. Like there’s no competitive element to it.”
            </p>

            <p>
                While the scene is very much a collective, it’s not a reach to say that without local label
                <a href="https://delayedgratificationrecords.bandcamp.com/">Delayed Gratification Records</a>,
                it wouldn’t look the same. Vladimir Necovski—whose brother, Ilija, would later become the guitarist and co-founder of En Love—started the label in his childhood bedroom back in 2013 as a way to get involved in the scene.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, DGR’s catalog reads a primer for the scene at large. Since its beginning, Necovski has put out over 60 releases—most of which are by Ohio bands—each a different shade of hardcore. There are extreme offerings like Rejoice; upbeat fist bumpers such as SLUG and S.M.I.L.E; and straight-edge champions like
                <a href="https://traumaxqueen.bandcamp.com/">TraumaxQueen</a>.

                “Without [Necovski], the scene doesn’t exist in the way it currently does,” says Snitchler. “He’s willing to ride for our scene and for the people involved more than anybody else. He also does a ton of work on bookings. Between booking, promoting shows, and then knowing which bands to put on shows to make them do well, he makes it so that people from out-of-state want to keep playing Ohio.”

                Early this year, DGR held a showcase featuring
                <a href="https://tenhigh216.bandcamp.com/">Ten High</a>,
                S.M.I.L.E., Circus, Rejoice, SLUG, and Last Gasp. Of the six bands that played, five were taking the stage for the first time, and five had released music during the pandemic, a testament to the scene’s relative infancy. Over 300 fans came out—something Necovski has never seen for a local hardcore gig.
            </p>

            <p>
                “I went into the night thinking 60 people would show up and it would mostly be just friends,” he says. “Instead, people were in line from doors through the first band. I credit it to a lot of new energy in Ohio hardcore as well as a lot of new people being interested in hardcore as well.” With that in mind, here are some key bands from the scene.
